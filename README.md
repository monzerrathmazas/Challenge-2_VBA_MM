# Module 2 Challenge

## Overview of Project

In this challenge, we have to edit and refactor the Module 2 so it could loop through all the data only one time in order to collect the same information from Module 1. This will help determine whether refactoring our code successfully made in VBA will run the script faster. 

## Analysis

#### 2017

When looking at the result in 2017, we could see that the stocks are giving us great retuen. Most of the boxes are green meaning that Steve's parents are making money. It was a great year to invest in stocks.

There's only one red box, meaning that TERP wasn't doing that great when it came to people investing. 

I also noticed that the lower the Total Daily Income, the higher the return. The higher The Total Daily Income, the lower the return.

#### 2018

In 2018, Steve didn't get his parents great results. Most of the returns are in the negatives. Steve's parents are losing money in the stocks purchased. Only two stocks are doing well, which are ENPH and Run. With the Total Daily Volume, the lower the number the lower the returnand the higher the Total Daily Volume the higher the return when it's negative.
